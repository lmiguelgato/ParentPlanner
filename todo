Features:
- Whatsapp bot
- Get weather at time/location of event (use LLM for unified date/time format, regardless of how it's expressed in natural language)
- Suggest events based on weather conditions (use LLM for suggestions)
- Scrape the HTML behind the event link, especially for ParentMap, that has a standard section titled "EVENT DETAILS"
- Tag events with # using LLM, so that they can be easily filtered in Telegram
- Connect to Google/Apple calendar
- Let the user filter by distance driving
- Schedule event notifications, no need to request for updates
- Cache events that were showed already, per user


Bug fixes:
- The KCLS events not always are located inside a Libary. Don't assume they are. Store all library names in a dictionnary?
- Addresses like this should provide the correct geocode: "Bellevue Botanical Garden, 12001 Main St., Bellevue"

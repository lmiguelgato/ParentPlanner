- Get weather at time/location of event (use LLM for unified date/time format, regardless of how it's expressed in natural language)
- Suggest events based on weather conditions (use LLM for suggestions)
- Scrape the HTML behind the event link, especially for ParentMap, that has a standard section titled "EVENT DETAILS"

Addresses like this should provide the correct geocode:
- Bellevue Botanical Garden, 12001 Main St., Bellevue

Fix:
- Event provider must have a method download_events that others inherit, not get_event
- The KCLS events not always are located inside a Libary. Don't assume they are. Store all library names in a dictionnary?
